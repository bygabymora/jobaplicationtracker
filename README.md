Welcome to the Job Research Tracker App!

Thank you for choosing our app to help you keep track of your job search process. This app is designed to help you manage your job applications efficiently by allowing you to store important information about each application.

Here's a quick guide on how to use the app:

Adding a new job application
To add a new job application, simply click on the "+New" button and fill in the required information, such as the company, the role, the date of application, and the stage of the application process. You can also attach your CV and cover letter used to each application so that you can easily refer back to them.

Tracking the stage of each application
The app allows you to track the stage of each application, from application submission to interview, to offer, and finally, to acceptance or rejection. You can update the stage of each application as you move through the process, allowing you to keep track of your progress and follow up with potential employers.

Editing and deleting applications
You can edit the details of each application at any time by clicking on the "Edit" button. If you've been successful in your job search and want to remove an application from the app, simply click on the "Delete" button.

Sorting and filtering applications
You can sort your applications by date, company, role, or stage, allowing you to quickly find the information you need. You can also filter your applications by stage or company, making it easy to see all the applications you've made to a specific company or at a specific stage of the process.
